### The IDP Birdhouse
A poignant sculptural installation combining micro-dioramas with a birdhouse motif to evoke the experiences of displacement. This project uses everyday domestic scenes to reflect on the resilience and vulnerability of those forced to leave their homes.

### Snow of War
A multidisciplinary project that visualizes the discrimination against women during wartime. “Snow of War” manifests as both a physical installation—featuring suspended, 3D-printed masks that seem frozen in a snowstorm—and an interactive digital experience, inviting participants to confront societal pressures and reclaim their identities.
